      Boot camps in general pretty fascinating to me because they cut out the bullsh*t and give you just what you need with a shove. I work best under pressure and love the thrill of learning something new. I think DBC is very opinionated about what works best for their students and forces a lot of interesting philosophies upon their students. I’m definitely going to drink the poison and try new things but we’ll see how well these things sit with me longterm. I’m a bit of a skeptic but I’m always the one with open doors to trying new things… I’m too old for anything to really make me nervous ☺
