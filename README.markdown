>*"This is a project that came to life in 2015 as a result of a five-day exploration with parallax scrolling. I've also written a Javascript + jQuery slideshow and it was my first time using media screen queries to create two different CSS files for mobile and desktop. Parallax scrolling has proven to be pretty difficult to control and it isn't very flexible with crossing various screen-sizes and browsers. I've designed this site mainly for desktop Chrome and iPhone 6 Safari. There is one set of graphics for desktop and another for mobile. While I was reading up on parallax, I noticed that there are several ways to construct it and perhaps one of them may be better suited for inter-screen-size adjustments."*

Fast tracking to 2017

Most of the code that I write these days is with [Qadium](https://qadium.com/). 


You can find [me on paper here](https://github.com/avinoz/avinoz.github.io/blob/master/alvin_shiu_2017.pdf).


Here are a few interesting experiments that I created to test the boundaries of UX/UI design using only CSS and JS:


[A. Creating the illusion of a responsive 3D spinning ball through JS calculations](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/avinoz/avinoz.github.io/blob/master/experiments/ball/ball.html)

[B. A means of exploring static data in 3D](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/avinoz/avinoz.github.io/blob/master/experiments/3Dgrid/3Dgrid.html)

[C. Animating the interface to respond to mouse location](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/avinoz/avinoz.github.io/blob/master/experiments/web-plane/web-plane.html)

[D. Dragging and resizing cards](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/avinoz/avinoz.github.io/blob/master/experiments/draggable/draggable.html)

[E. Expanding rows of a table for more info](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/avinoz/avinoz.github.io/blob/master/experiments/box-expand/box-expand.html)

[F. Flexbox in for tables](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/avinoz/avinoz.github.io/blob/master/experiments/flex-table/flex-table.html)

[G. My work with Flexbox for TopGirlCoder](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/avinoz/avinoz.github.io/blob/master/experiments/articles/articles.html)


For work in SVG and D3, please ping me and will show you upon request.
