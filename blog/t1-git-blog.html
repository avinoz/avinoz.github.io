      Version control is the ability to make a copy of your project, edit it and then merge it back into the original file while keeping all the records of your edits. 

Git is a version control system that tracks changes using URLs. 

Github is a website that stores Git repositories and people can collaborate with others by cloning the code, changing it locally and then uploading it.
