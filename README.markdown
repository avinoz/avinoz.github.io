This is a project that came to life as a result of a five-day exploration with parallax scrolling. I've also written a Javascript + jQuery slideshow and it was my first time using media screen queries to create two different CSS files for mobile and desktop. Parallax scrolling has proven to be pretty difficult to control and it isn't very flexible with crossing various screen-sizes and browsers. I've designed this site mainly for desktop Chrome and iPhone 6 Safari. There is one set of graphics for desktop and another for mobile. While I was reading up on parallax, I noticed that there are several ways to construct it and perhaps one of them may be better suited for inter-screen-size adjustments.

Here are some of the sources that were examined for this experiment:
